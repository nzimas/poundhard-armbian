# Run on the device. Leaves jackd + sclang(+scsynth) running in the background;
# the headless controller (run-controller.sh) then drives it over OSC.
#
# PoundHard ships its OWN self-contained scsynth/sclang bundle (bin/ lib/ plugins/
# share/ under $PH, installed by move/deploy-bundle.sh) — no other takeover needs to
# be on the device. $PH/share/sclang_conf.yaml points at PoundHard's own class
# library + Extensions.
