# Provision the SELF-CONTAINED scsynth/sclang runtime for PoundHard on the Move.
#
# PoundHard ships its own SuperCollider AND JACK runtime — this installs the vendored
# bundle (bin/ lib/ plugins/ share/ = scsynth, supernova, sclang, jackd, libjack, every
# UGen plugin it uses, the SC class library + Extensions, and a self-contained sclang_conf
# that points at PoundHard's own dirs). NO other project (wildrider, RNBO) is needed.
#
# The binaries in the bundle have their RPATH patched to PoundHard's own lib. That matters
# because scsynth/supernova/jackd carry RT file capabilities, and glibc runs a
# capability-carrying binary in secure-execution mode where LD_LIBRARY_PATH is discarded —
# so RPATH is the ONLY search path they have. The runtime was originally copied out of a
# wildrider install and kept ITS RPATH, which is why deploying to a device without
# wildrider produced "libsndfile.so.1: cannot open shared object file" and a stack stuck
# on "starting..." (issue #3). An RPATH can be shortened in place but never lengthened,
# so jackd (whose original path was too short to hold the full install path) points at
# /data/UserData/phlib, a symlink this script creates.
#
# The bundle is move/bundle/poundhard-sc-runtime.tar.gz in this repo. Refresh it from a
# working device with:
#   ssh root@<host> 'tar czf - -C /data/UserData/poundhard bin lib plugins share' \
#     > move/bundle/poundhard-sc-runtime.tar.gz
# ...and re-patch the RPATHs afterwards, or you will ship whatever paths that device had.
