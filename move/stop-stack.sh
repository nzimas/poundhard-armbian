# supernova and csound were missing here. A surviving supernova makes the next boot attach
# to an orphan server (ready, zero nodes, no audio); a surviving csound loses its JACK
# server with jackd and then sits there dead-but-present, which was enough to make
# run-csound.sh skip starting a live one — the CSOUND engine came back silent.
# jackd is NOT killed any more. Under Armbian it runs the native `move`
# driver and owns /dev/ablspi0.0 - it is the display + jogwheel host that
# the appliance launcher draws through. Killing it strands the device with
# a frozen screen and no input. Audio clients only:
