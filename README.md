# PoundHard

**A 16-track groovebox takeover for the Ableton Move** — built for edgy IDM,
rhythmic noise and percussion-centric experimental electronica.

A SuperCollider engine carries the DSP, a Python controller holds the
authoritative musical state, and a Schwung `ui.js` drives the Move's pads, step
buttons, encoders and screen. It began as a fork of the *wildrider* takeover's
plumbing and is now **self-contained**: it ships its own SuperCollider *and* JACK
runtime, so **Schwung is the only thing it needs on the device**.

## 📖 [Read the User Guide →](docs/USER-GUIDE.md)

**The [User Guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md) is both a tutorial and the manual.** It opens with
*Your first pattern* — twenty minutes from an empty machine to a track that plays itself —
and then documents every view, control, engine and modifier in full.

This README covers what PoundHard *is*, how to get it onto the device, and how it works
inside. For how to **play** it, go to the guide.

## What it is

- **16 tracks**, one per step button. Tracks start **empty**; you build your rig by
  assigning engines from the **engine palette**. Any engine can go on any track, and the
  assignment is **per pattern** — two patterns can carry completely different rigs.
- **21 assignable engines**, from digital drums and 6-operator FM through Mutable-style
  resonators and macro-oscillators to chaotic maps, bytebeat, wavetables, a sampler that
  mangles its captures through Csound, a realtime **Csound** synth with 26 architectures, and
  **JOLT**, a procedural breakbeat engine that rebuilds a real break every bar and never drifts.
- **A 16-step sequencer per track**, each with its own length and clock rate
  (**polymeter**), plus a per-step **cycle frequency** so a step can fire once every 2–8
  repetitions.
- **Per-step locks** on pitch, velocity, pan, a voice macro, the FX chain and — on SAMPLE
  tracks — the slice of the buffer a step plays.
- **A multimode filter on every track** that keeps its bass and its level as resonance rises.
- **Pattern generation with eighteen compositional recipes** — `SPARSE`, `WALL`,
  `POLYMETER`, `GLITCH`, `PROCESSION`, `INTERLOCK` and more. Each is a brief covering roles,
  density, register, accent shape, pan, pitch relationships and variation over time, and the
  generator **scores its own output** and repairs the weakest track before handing it over.
- **Eight mastering chains** on one continuum from restrained to destroyed — EQ, broadband
  and multiband compression, gain-compensated saturation, soft and hard clipping and a
  limiter, with the active chain's own parameters on the eight knobs. Measured +9.5 dB of
  loudness and 7.5 dB of crest-factor reduction across the eight, and switching is a 120 ms
  glide along one chain rather than a graph swap, so it cannot click.
- **32 auto-assigned, tempo-synced LFOs** in the modulation view — sample-and-hold and sine,
  each on a unique parameter, never on engine pitch, and completely non-destructive.
- **Seven non-destructive performance modifiers** — **HEAT**, **SHUFFLE**, **QUAKE**,
  **CHURN**, **BREAK**, **STROBE** and **WHIM**. None of them edits a pattern: every one is an overlay
  the engine plays instead, so a single sequence can evolve all night and switching them off
  gives you back exactly what you programmed.
- **Living steps** — mark steps and they **transform themselves** as you play: ratchets,
  timbre lurches, pitch leaps, pan throws and per-step delay/reverb.
- **Patterns are self-contained** — engines, every parameter, FX, mutes and sequences — and
  organised as a hierarchy: **16 pattern seeds**, each with its own row of **16 expansions**
  for developing variations on one idea without risking the original. Projects save to disk
  with an autosave recovery file.

The step buttons for tracks that contain events **pulse at the pace of their sequence**;
assigned-but-empty tracks glow steady-dim in their engine hue, and unassigned tracks are
dark — so you can read the whole rig at a glance.

## Recording & the web UI

The [recorder view](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#recorder-view) captures the master output (post-limiter, what
you hear) to **stereo 16-bit WAV** via a `DiskOut` synth in the engine, capped at
**7 minutes** per take, into `/data/UserData/poundhard/recordings/`.

Finishing a take enters a **tail** phase: the engine keeps writing while it reports
the master level to the controller (`/ph/amp`, ~10 Hz), and the file is only closed
once the signal has stayed below the silence threshold for a beat — so reverb and
delay tails are preserved. Tune it with `PH_REC_SILENCE` (default `0.004`; music
typically sits around `0.1–0.4`).

The controller runs a small **web UI** at **`http://move.local:7177`** where every
recording has a **▶ Play** button (audition in the browser) and a **Download**
button. The address is deliberately a general
PoundHard endpoint — more functions will live there over time. The port is
configurable via the `PH_WEB_PORT` environment variable.

## Deploy to the Move

**On the device you need Schwung** (PoundHard is a Schwung *overtake* module, and Schwung
supplies the shadow JACK driver). Nothing else: the SuperCollider engine **and** the JACK
server ship in PoundHard's own runtime bundle — no wildrider, no RNBO.

```bash
cd move
./deploy.sh [move-host]      # default host: move.local
# then on the Move: Schwung menu → overtake → PoundHard
```

`deploy.sh` runs three steps you can also run individually:

1. **`deploy-bundle.sh`** — installs PoundHard's **self-contained** audio runtime under
   `/data/UserData/poundhard`. The whole runtime — supernova, scsynth, sclang, **jackd
   and libjack**, every UGen plugin it uses (**mi-UGens** for RINGS/PLAITS/CLDS,
   **sc3-plugins** for many engines and the RESO/GREY effects, STK, ByteBeat…), the
   SuperCollider class library + Extensions, and a self-contained `sclang_conf` — is
   vendored in this repo at `move/bundle/poundhard-sc-runtime.tar.gz` and pointed at
   PoundHard's own dirs. **No other project (wildrider, RNBO) needs to be on the
   device** — only Schwung, which supplies the shadow JACK driver and hosts the module.

   It finishes with a **preflight**: every RT binary is executed once with an *empty*
   environment. That is exactly the state the loader puts them in at runtime (below), so
   an unreachable library fails here, at deploy time, instead of leaving the device sitting
   on "starting…" with the reason buried in a log.

   > **Why RPATH, not `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.** `scsynth`, `supernova` and `jackd` carry RT file
   > capabilities, and glibc runs a capability-carrying binary in **secure-execution mode**,
   > where `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is **discarded** — the RPATH compiled into the binary is the
   > only search path they have. The vendored runtime was originally copied out of a
   > *wildrider* install and kept **its** RPATH, so on a device without wildrider `scsynth`
   > died with `libsndfile.so.1: cannot open shared object file` even though that library was
   > sitting in `$PH/lib` (issue #3). The bundle's binaries are now patched to point at
   > PoundHard's own lib. An RPATH can be **shortened** in place but never lengthened, which
   > is why `jackd` — whose original path had no room — points at `/data/UserData/phlib`, a
   > symlink the deploy creates. Regenerating the bundle from a device means re-patching the
   > RPATHs, or you ship whatever paths that device happened to have.

   It also installs the **Csound runtime** (`move/bundle/poundhard-csound.tar.gz`) that the
   CSOUND engine runs as a JACK client: the binary, `librtjack.so` and a curated 20-plugin
   opcode set, plus two small tools the device lacks — **`ph-jackconnect`** (there is no
   `jack_connect`, and letting Csound auto-connect by port enumeration order would silently
   mis-wire all 34 channels the day another client joins the graph) and **`ph-rtsched`**
   (neither `chrt` nor `taskset` may touch a SCHED_FIFO thread without `CAP_SYS_NICE`, and
   the stack runs as `ableton`). Rebuild it with `move/build-csound.sh` (arm64 Docker).

   > The same RPATH rule bites Csound, and harder. It carries RT capabilities too, so its
   > `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is discarded — it could either find its libraries **or** run
   > realtime, never both, and silently chose the former by dropping every capability. Its
   > binaries are RPATH'd to `/data/UserData/pcslib` **and** `/data/UserData/phlib`: the
   > second is not optional, because `librtjack.so` links `libjack`, which is deliberately
   > *not* vendored into the Csound bundle (it has to be the same build the running `jackd`
   > speaks). Miss it and the JACK module fails to load, which surfaces as the thoroughly
   > misleading `could not connect to JACK server`.
2. **`deploy-controller.sh`** — the Python controller, vendored `python-osc`, the
   engine `.scd` files, the CSOUND orchestra (`csound/ph-engine.orc`), and the
   `run-*.sh` scripts.

   > It **re-asserts the RT capabilities** on every deploy. It used to run
   > `chown -R ableton:users` over the whole install, and chown **clears file
   > capabilities** — so deploying the controller silently stripped `cap_sys_nice` off
   > `jackd`, with nothing in the output to say so. It now chowns only what it ships.
   It also installs **CDP** (`move/bundle/poundhard-cdp.tar.gz`), the ~400-program set
   behind [Churn](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#churn), built from source by `move/build-cdp.sh`. No capabilities and
   nothing vendored alongside it: CDP only ever processes files, off the audio thread.
3. **`deploy-module.sh`** — the Schwung overtake module (`module.json` + `ui.js`
   + `exit-hook.sh`) under `/data/UserData/schwung/modules/overtake/poundhard`.

> Do **not** disable the Move's update services (`swupdate` / `UpdateDBusService`) to
> block auto-updates — `MoveControlModeHandler`, a boot-critical step, hangs forever
> when they're absent and the device won't finish booting (SSH still works). An
> earlier `disable-updates.sh` did this and had to be reverted.

> After a controller change, do a **full relaunch** (exit and re-enter) so the
> launcher starts the new controller — an old process from a prior session is
> otherwise reused.

## Develop off-device

The controller runs headless with no engine (OSC sends become no-ops), so kit
generation, pattern/project logic and the control/status protocol can be
exercised on any machine:

```bash
cd controller
PYTHONPATH="$PWD:$PWD/vendor" python3 -m poundhard.headless
# writes status.json, polls control.json (paths from $PH_SHARE)
```

---

---

## Architecture & internals

**The controller is authoritative** for musical state (a `Project`: 16 tracks ×
{engine type, note, velocity, parameters, pattern + per-step locks — pitch, velocity,
pan, voice macro, ratchet, living flag/period, FX mask, **cycle divider**, the **per-step
sample window**, the **per-step FX amount** and the **per-step filter** — mute, length, rate, **filter**}, plus FX assignment/bypass/macros, tempo, and the pattern bank — 16 seeds, each with a
lazily-allocated row of 16 expansions). A track
is at most **16 steps**; the per-step arrays are 32 wide for headroom and for projects
saved before the cap. It reads `control.json`, writes `status.json`, generates kits,
and pushes state to the engine over OSC.

**Modulation runs in the controller, not the engine.** `/ph/param` writes the engine's
per-track parameter store *and* sets the value on any ringing voice, but never touches the
controller's `Project` — so the 32-LFO bank can drive parameters continuously while nothing
is stored, and switching an LFO off simply re-sends the programmed value. Phase comes from
the bar position (`bars × cycles_per_bar`), resynced on the engine's own `/ph/cycle`, so
nothing free-runs and a tempo change carries the whole bank. Measured on the device, all 32
LFOs active cost **+0.6% DSP** — they send parameter messages and spawn no synths.

**Startup is a handshake, not a race.** The controller pings until the engine answers
`/ph/ready`, and until then it dispatches nothing — including whatever was left in
`control.json` by the previous session, whose high-water mark it adopts on its first
read rather than replaying. Pushing a machine's worth of state at a half-built graph
floods the server with messages for nodes that do not exist yet and can leave it
running-but-silent, which is a failure mode worth designing out rather than debugging
twice.

**The engine owns the step clock and the DSP.** The clock is a `TempoClock`
routine in `engine.scd`: it advances a per-track accumulator (so each track runs
at its own rate and length — polymeter), counts each track's repetitions so a step
carrying a **cycle divider** only fires on every Nth pass, spawns each active/unmuted
step's voice, streams the playhead back as `/ph/step`, and fires `/ph/cycle` on each
16-step bar boundary for queued pattern switching. Python stays at a relaxed rate for
UI/status only.

### Voice model

Voices are **spawned per hit, not persistent.** Each active/unmuted step spawns a
fresh one-shot synth from the track's stored params; it plays its envelope and
frees itself (`Line.kr … doneAction:2`). Persistent always-on voices were the
first design and **froze the Move** — 16 always-on synths overloaded the ARM even
at idle. Two guards keep it robust under dense IDM/noise patterns:

- **Per-track polyphony cap** (`~maxPoly = 3`, steal oldest) — without it dense
  patterns spawn faster than voices free, growing nodes unbounded until a freeze.
- **Per-mode DRUM defs** (`phDrumKick … phDrumNoise`, picked by the track's
  `mode`) — a hit runs only its mode's DSP, several times cheaper than an
  all-modes-then-`Select` voice.

**BYTEBEAT and CSOUND are the two exceptions.** BYTEBEAT's is forced by the UGen rather
than chosen: it
parses its expression *per instance* and starts on an `Undefined` expression that
evaluates to 0, so a freshly spawned instance is silent until its asynchronous `/eval`
lands. Spawning one per hit raced the parse against the note — long notes won it, short
ones came out inaudible, and the same sound was not reproducible twice. That track keeps
**one live voice**, parsed once and re-triggered per step (`t_trig`, `doneAction: 0`),
with a free-running counter — which is what bytebeat is anyway.

**CSOUND's** is structural: its audio is generated by a separate process and arrives over
JACK, so there is nothing to spawn per hit. Its SC voice is a permanent carrier reading
that track's input pair onto the track bus, and a hit is a score event sent to Csound. The
carrier is deliberately left alone once running — setting gain on it, or moving it between
buses for a per-step send, is heard as a step in the middle of whatever is still ringing,
including a reverb tail fed from it.

Each track has a **private stereo bus**; its voices write there, its FX chain
processes in place (each FX `ReplaceOut`s the bus in canonical order), and a send
sums it to the master. Node order: `gClear → gVoices → gFilt → gFx → gSend → gMaster`
(`gFilt` is the per-track multimode filter, one always-on insert per track).
Under supernova `gVoices` is a **ParGroup** with a serial subgroup per track, so tracks
render in parallel while each track's own chain stays ordered.

### The Move UI (ui.js) and file I/O

ui.js can't open sockets, so everything crosses the `ipc/{control,status}.json`
file bridge. The host's file I/O is **synchronous and can stall the frame**, so
the UI reads/writes as little as possible (change-detected status writes, reads
~5 Hz, coalesced control writes) and redraws only on visible change. Big values
use a **custom block-glyph renderer** (`drawBig` + `FONT`) because the host
`print` maxes at size 2 — the instrument is built for a user with a severe sight
impairment, so param / rate / macro / tempo readouts are drawn large and stay up
while a knob is touched.

---

---

## Wire protocols

### control.json (ui.js → controller)

A `cmds` queue de-duped by `seq` (a single-slot mailbox lost commands when the UI wrote
twice between polls). The queue left behind by a previous session is **never replayed** —
on its first read the controller takes the high-water mark and runs nothing — and no
command is dispatched until the engine reports ready.

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| engine palette | `audition`, `palettegen`, `assign`, `randtrack`, `genkit`, `drumaudition` / `drummode` (DRUM type picker), `smparm` (arm the SAMPLE capture) |
| tracks | `mute`, `solo`, `trackset` (pitch/amp/pan/rate), `voicemacro`, `voiceparam` (one named voice param — SAMPLE's window knobs), `trackfilter` (cutoff/res/type), `note`, `setlen`, `clearpat` |
| steps | `stepset` / `steptoggle`, `steplock`, `stepmacro`, `stepfx` (per-step FX mask), `stepfxamt` (per-step FX wet), `stepcycle` (fire every Nth repetition), `stepwindow` (per-step sample slice), `stepfilter` (per-step filter lock), `marklive` / `liveperiod` (living steps — the period is in PLAYS of the step, 1-8) |
| clipboard | `stepcopy` / `steppaste`, `rowcopy` / `rowpaste`, `trackcopy` (the Copy-button gestures) |
| generation | `stepgen` (a new sequence for one track, scale-aware), `joltpad` / `joltbreak` / `joltinit` / `joltauto` / `joltrate` / `joltmut` (JOLT's break variations, automation and continuous mutation) |
| performance | `heat`, `shuffle`, `quake`, `churn`, `break` + `breakint`, `strobe`, `whim` (the seven temporary overlays) |
| mastering | `mastprofile` (pick one of eight chains, or bypass), `mastknob` (one parameter of the active chain) |
| randomizers | `steprand` (toggle one per-step parameter's randomizer), `randdebug` |
| transpose | `transpose` (one track's sequence), `transposeall` (project-wide, the cursor keys) |
| FX | `fxassign`, `fxbypass`, `fxmacro`, `fxwet` |
| modulation | `lfoenter` (assign/refresh the bank), `lfopad` (toggle one LFO), `lfogen` (re-roll all 32) |
| macros | `heat` / `heatpct`, `shuffle`, `quake`, `churn`, `break`, `chaos` / `chaosreset` |
| patterns & projects | `savepat` / `loadpat`, `patdel`, `patcopy` / `patpaste` / `patclipclear`, `expenter` / `expfirst` (open a seed's expansions), `genvar`, `randpat`, `saveproj` / `loadproj`, `loadauto` |
| transport & system | `run`, `editenter` / `editexit`, `recpad`, `undo`, `panic` |

`tempo` is a continuous field applied on change, not a queued command.

### status.json (controller → ui.js)

Carries `ready / engine / cpu / nodes / running / tempo / step / editTrack / solo / kit /
webPort`, per-track `muted / active / note / vel / pan / amp / rate / length` plus
`start / end` (SAMPLE's playable window) and `fcut / fres / ftype` (the track filter), the engine `types` / role `names` and
`drumTracks / drumMode`, the FX view state (`fxTop / fxBypass / fxOn / fxMacro / fxWet /
fxNames`), and the open track's `edit` block: `steps`, the effective per-step
`stepNote / stepVel / stepPan / stepMacro`, `living / period / ratchet / active`,
`fx` (per-step FX masks), `cycle` (per-step dividers), `stepStart / stepEnd` (the effective per-step sample window)
and `stepFcut / stepFres / stepFtype` (the effective per-step filter), plus the project's
`scale` (`{root, name}`, or null until something pitched establishes it).

Also the pattern bank, which is a hierarchy rather than a flat 32: `patFilled` is the
**16 seeds**, `expFilled` the open seed's **16 expansions**, `expSeed` which seed's row is
open (-1 = none) and `expCur` which expansion is live (-1 = the seed itself), alongside
`patCur / patPending / projFilled`. Then the `autoSave` flag, `projCur` (which project is
loaded) and `canUndo / canRedo`, the seven performance modifiers (`heat / heatPct / shuffle /
quake / churn / brk / brkEvery / brkNow / strobe / whim`), the modulation bank (`lfo`, 32
per-pad states of 0 none / 1 assigned / 2 active, and `lfoOn`), the mastering chain
(`mast` / `mastName` / `mastKnobs` / `mastPos`) and the chaos macro (`chaos`), the SAMPLE capture state (`smpState / smpSrc / smpChain`), the recorder
(`recState / recSlot / recSlots / recElapsed / recAmp`), and `clipStep / clipRow` — whether
the Copy-gesture clipboard is holding a step or a row. The edit block also carries `rand`,
the list of per-step randomizers live on the open track.

## Gotchas

- **ui.js has no sockets** → everything goes through the `ipc/*.json` files, and
  the host's synchronous file I/O can stall the UI, so I/O is kept minimal.
- **LED calls differ:** pads/steps use `setLED` (Note On); the Play and track-row
  buttons use `setButtonLED` (CC). The knob CCs (71–78) and Play CC (85) fall in
  the same numeric range as the pad notes — handlers must match on message type,
  not just number.
- **The server is supernova, not scsynth.** `PH_THREADS` (run-engine.sh, default **3**)
  picks it: >0 = supernova with N DSP threads, 0 = scsynth. Supernova loads **only**
  `*_supernova.so` plugins (both sets ship in the bundle) and needs
  `cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource` on its binary or its parallel DSP threads
  can't go realtime — `chown` clears those caps, so `deploy-controller.sh` re-applies them.
  It also needs its lib path baked in as `DT_RPATH` (a capped binary ignores
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`). **GREY is server-conditional**: `GreyholeRaw` won't register on
  supernova, so under it GREY is rebuilt from core UGens (same knobs).
- **Parallelism comes from ParGroups, not from supernova alone.** `~gVoices` is a ParGroup
  of per-track groups and `~gFx` a ParGroup of per-track chains — safe because each track
  owns a private bus. Anything writing a SHARED bus stays serial: voices within one track,
  living-FX hits and palette auditions (`~gSharedVoices`), and the sends/master.
- **Engine boot needs `HOME=/data/UserData`** (a menu launch has HOME unset);
  scsynth & jackd need RT file-caps (re-applied on every deploy).
- **sclang OSC string args arrive as Symbols** — the engine uses
  `.asSymbol` / `.asInteger`.
- **No fallbacks:** a required dependency (a UGen, plugin, file) is called
  unconditionally and fails loudly if absent — features work or they don't.
- **Forwards compatibility:** older projects load into the current stack. A `FMTONE`
  track is remapped to **FM7** at load (the old 2-op params don't map onto 6-op, so it
  comes back as a default FM7 to re-roll), and an FX macro reads its direction with
  `.get(arg, 1)` so a project saved before a param was added won't `KeyError` mid-load —
  which used to crash the load and freeze the instrument. **FX are saved by SLOT INDEX**, so
  the chain can't be reordered silently: snapshots carry an `fx_layout` version, and a
  pre-VERB (v1) project is remapped on load — the flanger is dropped and CLDS/RESO/GREY
  slide down one slot, each carrying its own macro / wet / direction. Without that, a
  track's CLDS would have come back as RING.
- **A unit command sent with the node is lost.** `/u_cmd` delivered in the same instant as
  the `/s_new` that creates its node hits a node the server has not instantiated yet and is
  dropped — silently. That is how BYTEBEAT ended up mute: the ByteBeat UGen starts on an
  `Undefined` expression (silent) and only speaks once its `/eval` lands, so every voice was
  a coin flip. Defer the unit command a few control blocks after creating the node.
- **`Synth:onFree` only fires for a REGISTERED node.** Without `.register` the callback never
  runs, so a reference to a freed synth (panic frees everything under `~gVoices`) lives on and
  every later `.set` goes to a dead node — a track that is silent *forever* with nothing in the
  log but `node not found`.
- **`control.json` outlives the session.** The queue is on disk, so a restarting controller
  would replay the previous session's commands at an engine that is still booting. That wedges
  the graph: `ready` is true, `nodes` is 0, and nothing sounds. The controller now adopts the
  queue's high-water mark on its first read and holds every command until `/ph/ready`.
- **`ready: true` with `nodes: 0` means the graph is gone, not that your feature is broken.**
  Usually an orphaned supernova that survived a kill: the new sclang attaches to it, never runs
  `initTree`, and the default group (node 1) does not exist. Restart properly — and note that
  `pgrep -f "<pattern>"` inside an ssh command matches the ssh command line itself, so the
  remote shell kills its own session and the stack survives. Bracket the pattern
  (`bin/sclan[g]`) and verify with `ps` before starting again.
- **The engine recorder taps hardware bus 0**, so a capture includes anything else the Move is
  playing. If MoveOriginal has audio running, absolute levels are meaningless — verify DSP
  offline instead (`scsynth -N` with `-U plugins`), where the render is isolated and repeatable.
- **A spawned voice's args can be SHADOWED by stale `~pstore` entries.** `~pstore[t]` is
  never cleared when a track changes engine, so appending an arg *after* `merged.getPairs`
  in `~spawn` can lose to an older entry of the same name. This made SAMPLE tracks play the
  1024-frame silent buffer while auditioning worked perfectly (the preview path puts `buf`
  *before* the params). Set such values **into `merged`** — it's a dictionary, so a key can
  only hold one value. Symptom to watch for: correct-looking spawn logs but silence.
- **Only one takeover runs at a time**, and the ports are **shared** with the sibling
  takeovers (57110 scsynth/supernova · 57120 sclang · 57140 controller telemetry). A
  clean exit tears the stack down, but an **unclean** exit leaves a sibling's engine
  running — which both holds those ports and (before the fix) matched PoundHard's
  `pgrep -f "bin/sclang"` start-guard, so the engine silently never started and you got
  a half-stack (controller up, no sound). `run-stack.sh` now matches its **own** sclang
  by full path and clears any **foreign** SC engine/controller first (never `jackd` —
  that's the shared shadow server it reuses).
- **A process the teardown forgets is worse than one that dies.** `stop-stack.sh` used to
  kill `sclang`, `scsynth` and `jackd` but neither `supernova` nor `csound`. A surviving
  supernova makes the next boot attach to an **orphan server** — `ready` true, zero nodes,
  no audio. A surviving Csound loses its JACK client with `jackd` and then lingers
  *dead-but-present*, which was enough to make `run-csound.sh` skip starting a live one, so
  the CSOUND engine came back silent. Both are killed now, and `run-csound.sh` **replaces**
  any existing instance rather than adopting it.
- **`set -e` will skip the tail of a launch script.** The Csound launch used to sit at the
  end of `run-engine.sh`; any non-zero command above it ended the script first, so engine 20
  never started and nothing in the log said why. It is launched from `run-stack.sh` now, in
  its own subshell that waits for the server's ports and cannot be skipped by an unrelated
  failure upstream. A launcher that can silently not-launch is worth restructuring.
- **Realtime placement matters as much as realtime priority.** Csound came up at priority
  **65 — exactly supernova's DSP threads** — and unpinned across all four cores, so it
  competed with the very threads that consume its audio in the same JACK cycle and migrated
  between them mid-callback. That was the XRuns. It runs at **68**, above the DSP threads
  and below `jackd`, pinned to core 3. Measured: 0 XRuns over 25 s with four Csound tracks
  and reverbs at 43% CPU, where the same rig XRan before.
- **A limiter has to be after the sum, not on each voice.** Every Csound voice was
  individually under the ceiling and four overlapping hits on one track summed straight
  past it. Voices accumulate onto a per-track bus and one limiter runs after the sum. The
  same trap in miniature: that limiter is a UDO called once per track **by name**, because
  its detector and held gain are state and a runtime loop would reuse one instance for all
  17 pairs — a single loud track would have ducked every other one.
- **Deleting something must delete its state, not just its visible part.** Turning a step
  off removed the hit and left its pitch, velocity, pan, macro, FX mask, cycle divider,
  filter, window, ratchet, send and living mark in the slot, which the next step drawn
  there inherited. The fix derives the field list from the `Track` dataclass rather than
  writing it out, so a per-step parameter added later is cleared automatically — the
  hand-written list in `clear_pattern` had already drifted and was missing five fields.

The prebuilt `ByteBeat.so` is an aarch64 binary of GPL-3.0 source; its corresponding
source is upstream at github.com/midouest/bytebeat, and `move/build-bytebeat.sh`
reproduces the build.

The runtime bundle likewise ships prebuilt aarch64 binaries of GPL software —
SuperCollider (`scsynth`, `supernova`, `sclang`) and JACK2 (`jackd`, `libjackserver`,
`libjack`), the latter taken from the Move's own JACK build. Their corresponding sources
are the upstream projects named above; the binaries carry only a patched RPATH (the
library search path), no code changes.
