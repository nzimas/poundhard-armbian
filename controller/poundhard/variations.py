"""PoundHard pattern-variation generator.

The flagship generative feature: from the pattern the user is on, produce up to 8
new patterns that are **structurally and musically related** but clearly distinct —
recognizable as parts of the same piece. It first *analyses* the existing patterns
(active tracks, rhythmic density & onsets, the piece's pitch material, roles), then
applies bounded, musical transformations that ramp from subtle (variation 1) to bold
(variation 8).

Patterns are **self-contained**: a load restores every engine's params, the
engine-to-track assignment, FX and the sequences. So each variation carries the base's
sounds verbatim (that's the family resemblance) and only its *groove* is transformed —
and a variation that introduces a complementary instrument can simply carry that
instrument's sound itself, leaving the seed pattern untouched.

Melody is expressed as **per-step pitch locks** rather than by moving a track's default
note: it keeps the voice's identity intact while giving the line real movement.
