"""QUAKE — a temporary rhythmic transformation of the whole rig.

The third toggle on the bottom row, beside HEAT and SHUFFLE, and like them it is an
ENGINE-ONLY overlay: nothing here touches the pattern. Toggling off pushes every track's
own length and rate back and the rig plays exactly as programmed.

It combines the two things that make rhythm complex without making it arbitrary:

  POLYMETER  — tracks are given DIFFERENT LENGTHS. A 15-step track against a 16-step one
               shifts by a step every bar and comes back into phase after 16; a 12-step
               track against 16 realigns after 4. Mixing lengths that share a factor with
               16 against lengths coprime with it gives both short cycles you can hear
               resolve and long ones that keep moving underneath them.

  POLYRHYTHM — tracks are given RATIO CLOCK RATES. The engine's clock is a float
               accumulator (`~acc[t] += ~rate[t]`), so 3:2 and 7:5 are as native as x2 —
               there is no grid to fight. The ladder in the UI only exposes powers of two;
               this reaches the ratios between them.

WHAT MAKES IT MUSICAL RATHER THAN RANDOM

  * An ANCHOR is never touched. The densest drum-like track keeps its own length and rate,
    so the pulse survives and the result stays recognisably the same piece. Without this
    the whole rig drifts at once and you just hear a mess.
  * DENSITY decides how hard a track is hit. A busy track gets a small length change OR a
    mild ratio — never both, because a dense part under a 7:4 clock is mush. A sparse track
    can take the wild end, where it reads as a counter-rhythm rather than a smear.
  * Not everything moves. Roughly half to two thirds of the eligible tracks are
    transformed; the rest hold the frame the others move against.
  * Ratios are applied as MULTIPLIERS on the track's existing rate, so a track already
    running at x2 stays fast and keeps its role in the arrangement.
