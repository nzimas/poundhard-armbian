"""Algorithmic step-sequence generation for ONE track.

Shift + touch the volume knob + Track 1 in the edit view: the open track gets a new
16-step sequence, complete with its per-step locks. The aesthetic target is the same as
the rest of the instrument — IDM, rhythmic noise, abstract and textural electronica —
so the rhythm palette is deliberately wider than "Euclidean and its rotations":

  euclid          even distribution of k over n; the reliable spine
  euclid pair     two Euclids combined (AND / XOR / OR) — polyrhythm inside one bar
  asymmetric      additive grouping (3+3+2, 3+2+3, 5+3…), accents on group heads
  burst           dense clusters separated by gaps; the rhythmic-noise shape
  sieve           a grid thinned by a residue rule (every 3rd, offset 1) — irregular
                  but not arbitrary, and it repeats coherently
  fracture        a Euclid whose hits are displaced by one step at random points

Every generator returns hits ONLY; the character comes from what is then written into
each hit: velocity contour, pan movement, pitch (scale-aware — see `scales`), and cycle
dividers so some hits sit out most repetitions. A generated bar should not sound like
a random bar: accents fall in groups, pans move rather than jitter, and the pitch
material belongs to the piece.

    repetitions to come back round to where it started.
