"""BREAK — automatic, musically-placed breakdowns.

The fifth bottom-row toggle. Every N pattern cycles Break takes over for one cycle,
transforms what the rig is playing, and hands it straight back. Like the other modifiers it
is an ENGINE-ONLY overlay: the pattern data is never touched, and everything it changes is
pushed back from the controller's own (untouched) state when the break ends.

WHY IT IS NOT A TEMPLATE LIBRARY. A fixed set of canned breakdowns gives itself away in
about four repetitions. What makes a break sound programmed rather than triggered is that it
responds to what is actually playing: which tracks carry the pulse, which are ornament, how
dense the bar is, and how much room there is to take something away. So the *type* is chosen
from what the pattern can support, and the parameters inside each type are then rolled.

THE VOCABULARY. Every type below is built from four primitives the engine already has, none
of which edits a sequence:

  mute        drop a track for the break            (dropouts, kick-only, percussion-only)
  pattern     push a DIFFERENT step list temporarily (stutters, displacement, pauses, fills)
  rate        change a track's clock                (double-time stutters, half-time drags)
  filter      move the per-track filter             (filtered breakdowns, build-ups)

`pattern` is the interesting one: pushing a modified step list to the engine leaves
`state.tracks[t].pattern` completely alone, so restoring is just re-pushing the real thing.
