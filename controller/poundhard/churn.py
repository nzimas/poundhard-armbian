"""CHURN — the CDP end of the ornamentation modifier.

Churn records short fragments of the master, has CDP transform them, and drops the results
back into the performance where there is room. This module owns the middle step: building a
transform chain and running it. Capture, placement and scheduling live in the controller.

WHY CDP AND NOT MORE DSP. PoundHard already has twenty engines and eight inserts; another
reverb would add nothing. CDP's value here is that it is a *different kind* of
transformation — offline, non-realtime processes (spectral blurs, waveset mangles, brassage,
time warps) that cannot run in an audio callback at all. Churn is the only way that class of
sound gets into a live performance.

SPEED. Measured on the device with a pattern playing: a full spectral chain (pvoc anal →
blur → pvoc synth) on a 1.2 s fragment takes 0.28 s; waveset and varispeed stages are
0.02-0.03 s. A two-stage chain therefore lands well inside a bar, which is what makes a
continuous capture → transform → schedule pipeline possible at all.

THE FAMILIES. Structured after wildrider's CDP runner: recipes are grouped by the KIND of
transformation, and a chain draws its stages from DIFFERENT families, so results span the
space instead of clustering on lookalike smears. Every stage is guarded — CDP programs are
finicky and a failed one must not take the ornament with it.
